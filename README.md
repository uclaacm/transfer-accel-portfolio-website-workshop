# code your own website! (@ transfer accelerator '21)

Hi there! These are written notes, code demos, and checkpoints for a workshop that I ([Matt](https://matthewwang.me), he/him) ran at UCLA Engineering's Transfer Accelerator '21. The focus of this workshop is to teach a variety of engineering students how to **code and deploy their own personal portfolio website**. We teach HTML, CSS, a tiny bit of JS, and a working knowledge of git and GitHub - **all without assuming any prior programming experience.** By the end of the workshop, they will have a website that looks like this. TODO

As a note: this is technically "one workshop", but it's broken up into bite-sized chunks - feel free to take a peek at whatever interests you. Each chunk contains everything (code, tec.) you need to start it!

## FAQs

### Where can I find videos?

TODO

### What do I need to know to take this workshop?

The short answer: just how to use a computer! We don't assume any prior programming experience :)

TODO

### I'm a bit stuck on my website. Can I get help?

Yup! You've got a few options:

* reach out in the transfer accelerator Discord - our student mentors and instructors will be able to help you out!
* ask matt! he's in the transfer accelerator Discord, but you can also reach him at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me)
* see the below section :)

### I've got a question on a topic that's not directly covered in this workshop. Where should I look for help?

Good question! Luckily for us, the internet has tons of great resources, including Google! If a quick Google isn't super helpful, consider:

* TODO
* use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)! There's no shame, and it's likely that many others have run into your problem too!
* ask us! QWER Hacks has a mentor system through Discord, and quite a few of the mentors are experienced in React, Firebase/Firestore, and web development!

### Who is Matt?

Glad you asked! I ([Matt](https://matthewwang.me)) am a rising fourth-year CS & Math-Econ major at UCLA, and the current president of [ACM at UCLA](https://uclaacm.com). I'm really passionate about education, technology, and their intersection - which is something that I love doing at ACM! I'm also focused on about making tech a more diverse and welcoming place, which is an issue that definitely needs some work. I spend a lot of time working on EdTech, training developers, and doing mentorship - feel free to ask me about that!

In terms of work experience, I'm definitely not an absolute professional, but I've done quite a bit of web development over the years! I've worked with web technologies in a variety of contexts - in a startup, in a mid-sized company, at a handful of big tech companies, and in personal projects. HTML and CSS (the content of htis workshop) are the bread and butter of everything I do; beyond that, I've spent a bit *too* much time with React. The bigger list includes:

* web design with Photoshop, Figma
* frontend javascript: React, Angular, jQuery, typical vanilla JS, many libraries!
* backend-adjacent: webservers with Python (Flask, Django), PHP, Java
* databases: SQL, Firebase/Firestore/RTDB, some MongoDB
* devops: CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Netlify, Travis CI, AppVeyor), Docker, Kubernetes
* misc: git(hub), Electron, a handful of AWS things, static site generators

If you've got questions about these things, or more broadly anything related to web development, feel free to hit me up through Discord or via email!
